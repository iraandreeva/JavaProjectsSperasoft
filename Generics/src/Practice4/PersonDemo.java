//Collections Practice #2: Person List
//Implement a Person class with the following fields:
//name - String
//age - int
//Make the Person class implement Comparable interface (only age should be compared)
//Implement a comparator for the Person class comparing Person first by name and if the name is equal by age.
//Implement a method that accepts a list of Person objects and returns a list with unique Person objects (objects with the same name and age should be removed)
//Implement a method that accepts two lists of Person objects and returns a boolean depending on passed lists equality.
//Write a simple demo program to test:
//sorting of the Person list without comparator;
//sorting of the Person list using implemented comparator;
//both methods for removing duplicates and comparing two lists.
